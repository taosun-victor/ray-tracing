# Ray Tracing Practice
This project involves some basic practices for ray tracing algorithms. The fundamentals are implemented with C++.

## Shapes, Materials, Shadows
The basic shapes (spheres, triangles and planes) and materials (lambertian and metal) and shadows are implemented. To test a flavor of the basics,
```
cd ./basic
clang++ main-orth.cpp -o main-orth
./main-orth > basic.ppm
```
would generate the snapshot of the basic shapes and effects as the following.

## Bounding Volume Hierarchy
In order to accelerate the ray tracing process with sub-linear time complexity, the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) is implemented. The performance of BVH is compared with naive array-based containers with total number of objects as of 100, 1,000 and 10,000. The images and the time spent are listed as the following.

| object count  | 108  | 1,000  | 10,000|
| :-----:       | :-:  | :-:    | :-:   |
| array seconds | 143  | 1210   | 13278 |
| bvh seconds   |  35  |   66   |   187 |

It is shown that the bvh based container improves the time complexity from O(n) to O(logn) compared with native array-based containers.
